# 
# 
# ***The data contains the following information:***
# 
# **Country:**
# this is the country for which the vaccination information is provided.

# **Country ISO Code:** 
# ISO code for the country.
# 
# **Date:**
# date for the data entry; for some of the dates we have only the daily vaccinations, for others, only the (cumulative) total.
# 
# **Total number of vaccinations:**
# this is the absolute number of total immunizations in the country.
# 
# **Total number of people vaccinated:**
# a person, depending on the immunization scheme, will receive one or more (typically 2) vaccines; at a certain moment, the number of vaccination might be larger than the number of people.
# 
# **Total number of people fully vaccinated:**
# this is the number of people that received the entire set of immunization according to the immunization scheme (typically 2); at a certain moment in time, there might be a certain number of people that received one vaccine and another number (smaller) of people that received all vaccines in the scheme.
# 
# **Daily vaccinations (raw):**
# for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date/country.
# 
# **Daily vaccinations:**
# for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date/country.
# 
# **Total vaccinations per hundred:**
# ratio (in percent) between vaccination number and total population up to the date in the country.
# 
# **Total number of people vaccinated per hundred:**
# ratio (in percent) between population immunized and total population up to the date in the country.
# 
# **Total number of people fully vaccinated per hundred:**
# ratio (in percent) between population fully immunized and total population up to the date in the country.
# 
# **Number of vaccinations per day:**
# number of daily vaccination for that day and country.
# 
# **Daily vaccinations per million:**
# ratio (in ppm) between vaccination number and total population for the current date in the country.
# 
# **Vaccines used in the country:**
# total number of vaccines used in the country (up to date).
# 
# **Source name:**
# source of the information (national authority, international organization, local organization etc.).
# 
# **Source website:**
# website of the source of information.
